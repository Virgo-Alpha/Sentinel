# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Terraform infrastructure configuration for the Sentinel cybersecurity system has multiple validation errors that prevent successful deployment. These errors span across variable declarations, resource configurations, and provider compatibility issues. This feature will systematically resolve all Terraform plan errors to enable successful infrastructure provisioning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all Terraform variables to be properly declared, so that I can deploy infrastructure without variable warnings or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running terraform plan THEN the system SHALL NOT display warnings about undeclared variables
2. WHEN variables are defined in tfvars files THEN corresponding variable blocks SHALL exist in variables.tf
3. WHEN variables are referenced in modules THEN they SHALL be properly passed through from root to child modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all AWS resource configurations to use valid attributes, so that Terraform can successfully create infrastructure resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring API Gateway stages THEN the system SHALL use correct attribute names for access logging
2. WHEN defining S3 lifecycle configurations THEN the system SHALL specify required filter or prefix attributes
3. WHEN using AWS provider resources THEN all attributes SHALL be supported by the current provider version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all resource types to be supported by the AWS provider, so that infrastructure provisioning doesn't fail due to unsupported resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN referencing AWS resources THEN all resource types SHALL be supported by the hashicorp/aws provider
2. WHEN using Cost Explorer resources THEN the system SHALL use correct resource type names
3. WHEN defining monitoring resources THEN all referenced resources SHALL be declared in the module

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want conditional logic in Step Functions to have consistent types, so that state machines can be created without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using conditional expressions in Step Functions THEN both true and false branches SHALL have consistent object structures
2. WHEN enabling/disabling agents THEN the conditional logic SHALL handle all required state definitions
3. WHEN defining state machine workflows THEN all referenced states SHALL be properly defined in both conditional branches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want WAF configurations to use valid block types, so that web application firewall rules can be properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring WAFv2 web ACLs THEN the system SHALL use supported block types
2. WHEN defining WAF rules THEN all dynamic blocks SHALL use correct attribute names
3. WHEN applying WAF configurations THEN the syntax SHALL be compatible with the current AWS provider version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a clean terraform plan output with no errors or warnings, so that I can confidently deploy infrastructure to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running terraform plan THEN the system SHALL complete without any errors
2. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL pass all syntax and reference checks
3. WHEN planning deployment THEN all resources SHALL be properly configured and ready for creation
