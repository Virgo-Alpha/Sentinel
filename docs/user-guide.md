### Article Review Process

#### 1. Article Analysis
When reviewing an article, analysts see:

**Article Header**
- Title and source information
- Publication date and discovery time
- Relevancy score and confidence level
- Matched keywords with context

**Content Analysis**
- Full article text with keyword highlighting
- Extracted entities (CVEs, vendors, products)
- Similar articles (duplicates and related content)
- AI-generated summary and key points

**Metadata**
- Original URL and source feed
- Processing timestamps
- Previous analyst decisions (if any)
- Related articles and references

#### 2. Decision Making
Analysts can make the following decisions:

**Relevant** ✅
- Article is relevant to organizational security
- Should be included in reports and alerts
- May trigger notifications to stakeholders

**Not Relevant** ❌
- Article is not applicable to organization
- Will be filtered out of reports
- Helps train the AI for future assessments

**Needs Escalation** ⚠️
- Requires senior analyst or manager review
- Uncertain relevancy or high impact potential
- Complex technical content requiring expertise

**Duplicate** 🔄
- Article is a duplicate of previously processed content
- Links to original article for reference
- Improves deduplication algorithm accuracy

#### 3. Adding Context
Analysts can enhance articles with:

**Comments and Notes**
```markdown
## Analyst Notes
- Affects our Azure AD tenant configuration
- Similar to incident from Q2 2023
- Recommend immediate patching of production systems
- Coordinate with IT team for implementation timeline

## Impact Assessment
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Systems**: All Azure AD integrated applications
- **Mitigation**: Available patch, testing required
- **Timeline**: 48-72 hours for full deployment
```

**Tags and Categories**
- Custom organizational tags
- Impact categories (infrastructure, applications, data)
- Response priority levels
- Stakeholder notifications

### Bulk Operations

For efficiency, analysts can perform bulk operations:

#### Bulk Review
- Select multiple similar articles
- Apply same decision to all selected items
- Add bulk comments and tags
- Mass escalation for complex topics

#### Smart Filtering
```sql
-- Example filter queries
priority:critical AND source:CISA
keywords:(Azure OR "Microsoft 365") AND published:today
status:pending AND relevancy:>80%
```

## Natural Language Queries

Sentinel's natural language query interface allows users to ask questions in plain English and receive relevant cybersecurity intelligence.

### Query Interface

#### Accessing Natural Language Search
1. Navigate to **"Intelligence Search"** or use the search bar
2. Type your question in natural language
3. Review results with relevancy scoring
4. Refine queries for better results

#### Example Queries

**Vulnerability Queries**
```
"What Azure vulnerabilities were discovered this week?"
"Show me critical CVEs affecting Microsoft products"
"Are there any new exploits for our network infrastructure?"
```

**Threat Intelligence Queries**
```
"What ransomware campaigns are targeting healthcare?"
"Show me recent phishing attacks against financial institutions"
"What are the latest APT group activities?"
```

**Product-Specific Queries**
```
"Any security updates for Fortinet FortiGate?"
"Show me Mimecast security advisories from last month"
"What Cisco vulnerabilities need immediate patching?"
```

**Trend Analysis Queries**
```
"What are the trending cybersecurity threats this quarter?"
"Show me the most common attack vectors this month"
"Which vendors had the most security updates recently?"
```

### Query Processing

#### Understanding Your Query
Sentinel processes natural language queries through:

1. **Intent Recognition**: Identifies what type of information you're seeking
2. **Entity Extraction**: Finds specific products, vendors, timeframes
3. **Keyword Mapping**: Maps natural language to configured keywords
4. **Context Analysis**: Understands the security context and urgency

#### Query Enhancement
The system automatically enhances queries by:
- Adding relevant synonyms and variations
- Expanding abbreviations (CVE, APT, etc.)
- Including related terms and concepts
- Applying organizational context and priorities

### Advanced Query Syntax

#### Structured Queries
For power users, Sentinel supports structured query syntax:

```

keywords:Azure

# Relevancy and scoring
relevancy:>80%
priority:critical
status:reviewed

# Combination queries
(source:CISA OR source:Microsoft) AND keywords:Azure AND published:today
```

#### Query Operators
