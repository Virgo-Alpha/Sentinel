# CloudFormation Template Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated `sentinel-infrastructure-complete.yaml` to include the missing Cognito, Amplify, and Bedrock AgentCore resources that were previously only configured as feature flags.

## Added Resources

### 1. Cognito Authentication Resources
- **CognitoUserPool**: User pool with email verification and strong password policies
- **CognitoUserPoolClient**: Client for web application authentication
- **CognitoIdentityPool**: Identity pool for AWS resource access
- **CognitoIdentityPoolRoleAttachment**: Role mapping for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- **CognitoAuthenticatedRole**: IAM role for authenticated users with API Gateway access
- **CognitoUnauthenticatedRole**: IAM role for unauthenticated users (deny all)

### 2. API Gateway Resources
- **ApiGateway**: REST API for web interface
- **ApiGatewayAuthorizer**: Cognito-based authorizer for API endpoints
- **ApiGatewayDeployment**: Production stage deployment with logging and metrics

### 3. Amplify Web Application Resources
- **AmplifyApp**: Web application hosting with environment variables
- **AmplifyBranch**: Main branch configuration with auto-build
- **AmplifyServiceRole**: IAM role for Amplify service operations

### 4. Bedrock AgentCore Resources
- **BedrockAgentRole**: IAM role for agent operations with comprehensive permissions
- **BedrockKnowledgeBase**: Vector knowledge base for RAG capabilities (requires OpenSearch)
- **BedrockKnowledgeBaseRole**: IAM role for knowledge base operations
- **OpenSearchCollection**: Serverless vector storage collection
- **IngestorAgent**: Main cybersecurity news processing agent
- **IngestorAgentAlias**: Environment-specific agent alias

## Added Parameters
- **AmplifyRepositoryUrl**: Git repository URL for Amplify deployment
- **AmplifyCallbackUrls**: OAuth callback URLs for authentication
- **AmplifyLogoutUrls**: OAuth logout URLs for authentication

## Added Conditions
- **EnableAgentsAndOpenSearchCondition**: Combined condition for features requiring both agents and OpenSearch

## Added Outputs
### Cognito Outputs
- UserPoolId, UserPoolClientId, IdentityPoolId, UserPoolArn

### API Gateway Outputs
- ApiGatewayId, ApiGatewayUrl, ApiGatewayAuthorizerId

### Amplify Outputs
- AmplifyAppId, AmplifyAppArn, AmplifyAppUrl, AmplifyDefaultDomain

### Bedrock AgentCore Outputs
- IngestorAgentId, IngestorAgentArn, IngestorAgentAliasId
- BedrockKnowledgeBaseId, BedrockKnowledgeBaseArn
- OpenSearchCollectionArn, OpenSearchCollectionEndpoint

## Key Features

### Security
- Strong password policies for Cognito users
- Least privilege IAM roles
- Encrypted storage with KMS
- Proper CORS and OAuth configuration

### Scalability
- Serverless architecture (Amplify, Lambda, OpenSearch Serverless)
- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Pay-per-use billing models

### Integration
- Seamless integration between Cognito, API Gateway, and Amplify
- Bedrock agents with knowledge base integration
- Environment variable injection for frontend configuration

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Validate Template
```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template --template-body file://sentinel-infrastructure-complete.yaml
```

### 2. Deploy with Updated Parameters
```bash
./deploy.sh -e prod -a update
```

### 3. Configure Components
Follow the detailed instructions in `COGNITO_AMPLIFY_AGENTCORE_DEPLOYMENT.md` for:
- Creating Cognito users and groups
- Connecting Amplify to Git repository
- Preparing and testing Bedrock agents
- Configuring API Gateway endpoints

## Important Notes

### Conditional Deployment
- Cognito and Amplify resources only deploy when `EnableAmplify=true`
- Bedrock Agent resources only deploy when `EnableAgents=true`
- Knowledge Base requires both `EnableAgents=true` AND `EnableOpenSearch=true`
- OpenSearch Collection deploys when `EnableOpenSearch=true`

### Prerequisites
- Bedrock model access must be enabled in your AWS account
- Git repository must be accessible for Amplify deployment
- Proper IAM permissions for all services

### Cost Considerations
- OpenSearch Serverless has minimum charges even when idle
- Bedrock model invocations are pay-per-use
- Amplify has build minute charges
- Cognito has monthly active user charges

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated template
2. Follow the configuration guide for each component
3. Test authentication flow end-to-end
4. Configure monitoring and alerting
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines for frontend deployment

The template is now complete with all necessary resources for a fully functional Sentinel cybersecurity platform with web interface, authentication, and AI-powered content processing.
